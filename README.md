## Description:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This fun little app takes in your input, either an alcohol type or a specific cocktail, then retrieves the name, image, and instructions on how to create a specific cocktail based on your input. Fun to use when you have a selection of alcohols to choose from, but don't know how to create a specific drink!

## Lessons Learned:

Ah, my first app that used an API to fetch data for us...I'll always remember the struggle I first had with building out this app. It's a reminder to me that documentation is immensely important whenever you're building out an API. Without proper documentation, this app would have probably never seen the light of day!
